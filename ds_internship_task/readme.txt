Task:
- Build a model that predicts "charges" for a given person based on their features.
- Evaluate the quality of your model.
- Identify the factors with the highest impact.

Expected result - link to a GitHub repo with:
- Code for the solution (any programming language, Python or R preferred).
- Brief summary of the solution*: what did you do, which steps did you make, how to interpret the results.

* Both code and solution can be a single report file, e.g. .ipynb or .rmd
